SAP GUI (Graphical User Interface) is the standard client software used to access SAP systems such as ERP and S/4HANA. It enables enterprise users to interact with SAP applications across modules like finance, logistics, HR, and more.

This offline installation guide is designed for IT professionals, consultants, and enterprise teams working in restricted or airgapped environments. It allows full SAP GUI deployment without requiring online activation, SAP Marketplace login, or cloud sync. All connection settings can be configured locally using `.saplogon.ini` or `.xml` profiles.
